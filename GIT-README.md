# First GitHub Cloning Project

This is my first GitHub project created to understand the basics of Git and GitHub.  
The project focuses on learning repository cloning, version control, and commits.  
I practiced cloning repositories using Git CLI and managing files locally.  
This helped me understand Git workflows like add, commit, and push.  
The project also improved my confidence in using GitHub for collaboration.  
All changes are tracked properly using Git version control.  
This repository is beginner-friendly and well-structured.  
It reflects my hands-on learning approach.  
Future improvements and updates will be added regularly.  

Thank you for checking out my first GitHub project!
